## Review:
- In my opinion from what i had done, it can easily see that there is no different in IP address when i enter a "Viet Nam" website, but with some global website such as google, facebook or netflix, we can see a little bit different in IP address.  
- I think the problem is i have created a southeast asia zone VPS so it is nearly the same location as my laptop that leads to the same IP address.. or my code still have some problems :)
